# Liquid crystal display
<img align="left" src="pic/LCD.png" width=100/> In this project the piloting technique of a liquid crystal display (LCD) is presented. We will study how the display segments are switched on by writing a test program for automatic counting from the value 0 to the value 1999.
## Introduction
Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) are widely used devices for displaying data. Sometimes these displays are segmented (as in our case) other times they are dot matrix. The former allow the display of digits and characters while the latter can also display images. Segment LCD displays have a similar display to that seen for 7-segment LED displays but have a completely different driving principle; in fact, since they are made with liquid crystals, they must be controlled with alternating voltages to continuously reverse the direction of the current inside the segments. If we did not do this we would have two drawbacks: we would not display anything and we would damage the display irreparably. We add for completeness that there are LCD modules on the market already equipped with internal controller (type HD44780); in this case, the use of the display consists in simply sending appropriate commands to the module which already provides an integrated logic for driving the individual segments.
## 7-segment LCD

The backplane (indicated in the figure as Common Plane) represents a common reference plane with respect to which all the segments in the foreground of the display are powered. In practice, a segment lights up if the potential at its pin is different from the potential on the backplane pin; the segment is turned off if it has the same potential as the backplane. Since we want the current in the segments to continuously change direction then we will send a square wave signal of suitable frequency (usually above 30Hz to avoid flickering) on the backplane pin and square wave signals with the same frequency on the segment pins, with voltage value equal to the backplane to keep segments off or different value to keep segments on.

Furthermore, when this happens, the value is alternated so as not to damage the segment.
