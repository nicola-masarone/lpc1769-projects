# A general look
The project presented here simulates the management of a traffic light intersection with three times: time A for vehicles in one direction, time B for vehicles in the other direction and time P dedicated to pedestrians.
## The assembly plan
The circuit used for the demonstration involves the use of the development board for LPC1769 and an external breadboard with 9 LEDs dedicated to the three user streams of the intersection, according to the assembly diagram shown in the following figure.
