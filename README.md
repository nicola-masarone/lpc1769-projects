# lpc1769-projects.
Simple projects for lpc1769 microcontroller from NXP.

Each folder beginning with *lpc1769* contains a separate project, with a description either for software either for hardware.

Please note that two folders (*/lpc_board_nxp_lpcxpresso_1769* and */lpc_chip_175x_6x*) contain proprietary software from NXP, as described in their LICENSE files. This software is needed to compile projects in other folders.

+ [*LED in sequence with variable speed*](https://github.com/nicola-masarone/lpc1769-projects/tree/master/lpc1769_LEDs). The experience involves the use of 8 LEDs to be switched on in sequence with adjustable speed, based on the pressure of a button. The skills acquired at the end of this practical include the use of GPIO in input and output, with interrupt management on the input. The system timer is also used with relative management of the interruption for the switching speed of the LEDs.
+ [*7-segment display management*](https://github.com/nicola-masarone/lpc1769-projects/tree/master/lpc1769_7seg). The tutorial provides instructions for driving a 7-segment display consisting of two side-by-side digits. The acquired skills will allow to use this simple output device as a data visualization tool for a subsequent exercise.
