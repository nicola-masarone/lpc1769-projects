# PWM color LED driving
With this experience, students learn to manage an RGB-type color LED using the PWM control to adjust the intensity of the colors, thus modifying the resulting hue.
## Introduction
An RGB type color LED is basically the union of 3 different colored LEDs: red, green and blue. The driving of the single colors is realized with the PWM outputs of the microcontroller; in this way we can control the luminous intensity of the component colors and thus adjust the overall resulting color.
## The RGB LED
Il componente usato nell'esperienza Ã¨ riportato nella figura seguente:
