# Signal acquisition with ADC
The experiment allows the student to develop the skills for the acquisition of a voltage signal by means of an analog-digital converter (ADC), with visualization of the value on a 7-segment display.
## Introduction
Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) is the technique that allows you to transform an analog signal (continuous in time and amplitude) into a numerical sequence that can be used by the central processor of the microcontroller. The purpose of the experience is to show how the conversion takes place and how to use it to transform a voltage signal into a number. The number obtained will then be displayed on the 7-segment display according to the procedure already seen in the experience of     [7-segment display management](../lpc1769_7seg#7-segment-display-management), to which reference should be made for the entire data display part.
