# Rotary encoder
In this experience the rotary encoder (rotary switch) is used to study the operation of the QEI (Quadrature Encoder Interface) present in the LPC1769 microcontroller. The project provides for the reuse of what is already known from the [*7-segment display management*](../lpc1769_7seg) for the data display section.
