# The I<sup>2</sup>C bus
Among the various communication buses available, the I<sup>2</sup>C has proved to be among the most flexible and easy to use over time, determining its success and rapid diffusion in various fields of automation. To adequately present this bus, we will refer to the official documentation of NXP, the parent company of the standard born in 1982, when the manufacturer was still called Philips. The specification file is available at the following address: [*I<sup>2</sup>C-bus specification and user manual*](https://github.com/nicola-masarone/lpc1769-projects/blob/master/lpc1769_I2C/UM10204.pdf). This document, now in its sixth revision, was last updated on 4 April 2014.
