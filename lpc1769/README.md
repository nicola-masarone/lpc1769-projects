# lpc1769 base project
This project is the starting point for all other projects.

It just blinks a few times the integrated red LED on the developer board for lpc1769 microcontroller from NXP.

It is useful in order to check that all is working, from IDE (MCUXpresso) to developer board (OM13085), including USB connection.
