# Overview
The project realizes the driving of a [*CEP-2242*](cep-2242.pdf) buzzer by means of a PWM signal. In this mode it is possible to manage both the volume of the sound (by acting on the duty-cycle) and on the frequency of the sound (by modifying the period). The buzzer is controlled by a PNP [*BC557B*](BC556.pdf) type BJT, supplied in the Embedded Artists development kit. Use of the BJT avoids requiring excessive current to the microcontroller port.
