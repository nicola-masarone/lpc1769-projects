# Humidity and temperature sensor
## Introduction
<img align="right" src="pic/termostato.png" width=100/> The measurement of humidity and temperature has many applications, both in the consumer field and for the production of goods and services. In the first case, just think of the devices present in all homes for the automatic adjustment of climatic parameters,  while in the second case it is possible to refer to the regulation of the microclimate in greenhouses for cultivation or in the exhibition rooms of works of art in a museum.

The output is digital and therefore requires the use of a microcontroller, both for display and for any remote recording or transmission.
