# 7-segment display management
The tutorial provides instructions for driving a 7-segment display consisting of two side-by-side digits. The acquired skills will allow to use this simple output device as a data visualization tool for a subsequent exercise.
## Introduction
The 7-segment displays are a simple but effective output device for displaying numbers or (some) letters. The ease of use linked to the simplicity of understanding the technology used (LED) allows the student to learn clearly what is proposed, creating a useful basis for future exercises in which it is necessary to view results in the form of data.
## 7-segment display
7-segment displays are the simplest and oldest display devices; despite this they are still widely used both for educational purposes and in particular applications where the need for high visibility makes the use of this technology useful. In our case the device consists of a set of LEDs mounted in such a way as to form two digits according to the following figure:
