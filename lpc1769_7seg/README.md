# 7-segment display management
The tutorial provides instructions for driving a 7-segment display consisting of two side-by-side digits. The acquired skills will allow to use this simple output device as a data visualization tool for a subsequent exercise.
## Introduction
The 7-segment displays are a simple but effective output device for displaying numbers or (some) letters. The ease of use linked to the simplicity of understanding the technology used (LED) allows the student to learn clearly what is proposed, creating a useful basis for future exercises in which it is necessary to view results in the form of data.
## 7-segment display
7-segment displays are the simplest and oldest display devices; despite this they are still widely used both for educational purposes and in particular applications where the need for high visibility makes the use of this technology useful. In our case the device consists of a set of LEDs mounted in such a way as to form two digits according to the following figure:

Even if we talk about a 7-segment display, actually inside it we find 8 LEDs for each digit (7 that make up the digit plus one that lights up the decimal point). We note from the wiring diagram that the LEDs of the same digit have the anode in common while the cathodes are in common for corresponding segments in the two digits (A-A, B-B, ...). The particular architecture requires connecting one of the two anodes (pin 9 for digit 1 or pin 4 for digit 2) to the high logic level (about 3V) and then to place the current limiting resistors placed at the low logic level (0V) in series with the cathodes of the LEDs we want to turn on (to illuminate the respective segment). Obviously this means that we can only illuminate one digit at a time. How then to illuminate the two figures at the same time? To be precise this would be impossible but it becomes achievable thanks to the slowness of the human eye. In fact, if we manage to turn on the figures in different instants but very close to each other (high frequency) our eye does not notice the trick and we have the feeling that the two figures are on at the same time. Let's take an example: let's say our goal is to display the number 34. It is made up of two digits: 3 (segments A-B-C-D-G) and 4 (segments B-C-F-G). Then we must first power pin 9 (common anode figure 1) and ground the resistors of pins 10, 8, 1, 5, 7 (cathodes segments A-B-C-D-G).

</p>
Then we have to interrupt the power supply to pin 9 (turning off the LEDs of digit 1) and power pin 4 (common anode digit 2) and then set the resistors of pins 8, 1, 6, 7 to ground (cathodes segments B-C-F-G).

We note that all this can also be achieved with simple manual switches (apart from the impossibility of obtaining in this way frequencies such as to deceive our eye).

Note that the two transistors used are polarized components (see the following figure):
<p align="center">

</p>
then the pins must be mounted exactly as shown in the figure (emitter connected to the red power supply bar, collector connected to the common anode of the 7-segment display, base connected to the 10k立 driving resistor). The 7-segment display also has an assembly order that includes decimal points at the bottom, as shown in the figure:

## Design of the driving circuit of the common anodes
The power supply to pins 9 and 4 of the 7-segment display (common anodes) cannot be supplied directly from the pins of the microcontroller because too much current would be required to power the lit LEDs (up to a maximum of 8 simultaneously). For this reason, a PNP type BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor) transistor is interposed between the pin of the microcontroller and the common anode, controlled by a resistor based on approximately 10k立 (see the following figure):
<p align="center">
  <img src="pic/bjt_out_schem.png" width=500/>
</p>

Translation for the comment from the picture above: *the two BC557B BJTs work as switches, controlled by pins P2.11 and P2.10 of the micro. When the pin is at logic low (logic negated) the corresponding BJT is a closed switch (feeds the 7-segment display digit).*

Note that the transistors power the display LEDs when the logic value applied to the base is low (0V). Otherwise the LEDs of the corresponding digit are off (logic denied or low active).

## Design of the cathode driving circuit
As for the cathodes of the LEDs, more or less what we saw in the LED project in sequence with variable speed is repeated, with the variation that this time the LEDs are connected with the anode to the common power supply and the cathode to the current limiting resistor which in turn is connected to the output pin of the microcontroller (see figure below):
<p align="center">
  <img src="pic/inv_LED_output_schem.png" width=250/>
</p>

Note that in this case the command logic is inverted: to turn on the LED, the pin of the microcontroller must be at a low logic level (0V).
